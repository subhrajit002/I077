📄 User Story: Dynamic Seasonality Adjustment for Demand Forecasting


---

✅ Overview

The system should detect and incorporate dynamic seasonality patterns into demand forecasting. These patterns refer to recurring demand fluctuations caused by seasonal changes or events that do not occur in fixed weeks or months every year. Since the timing of seasons and events can shift across years, the system must be capable of recognizing and adapting to these changes. This ensures that demand predictions remain accurate even when seasonal influences move on the calendar.


---

⚙️ Functional Requirements

The system must identify recurring seasonal patterns from historical demand data across multiple years.

Seasonal windows must be detected based on actual calendar dates rather than static week or month numbers.

The model must apply a week shifting logic to account for year-to-year variations in seasonal timing.

If a seasonal event or pattern appears in different months or weeks in different years, the system should align these instances dynamically and learn the common demand behavior.

The system should handle varying lengths of seasonal periods — short events (like festivals) or long ranges (like summer/winter sales).

The forecast engine must adjust future predictions using the learned seasonal effects for corresponding periods in the forecast horizon.

Seasonal impacts should be applied in a modular way, allowing them to be analyzed, tuned, or removed if needed.

The system should be able to handle years with both 52 and 53 weeks without misalignment of seasonal patterns.

🎯 Acceptance Criteria

✅ The system detects and learns seasonal demand spikes and drops from historical data.

✅ Learned seasonal patterns are based on calendar date alignment, not static week numbers.

✅ When the same seasonal event shifts its timing across years, the model adjusts the pattern using week shifting logic.

✅ Seasonal windows are flexible in length and can span multiple weeks.

✅ Forecast output reflects seasonal demand adjustments accurately in future predictions.

✅ The system handles 52-week and 53-week years without breaking the alignment of seasonal data.

✅ Seasonal effects are stored and applied as separate layers in the model to enable transparency and explainability.

💬 Description (In Simple Words)

Some demand patterns repeat every year, like high sales during certain seasons or events. But the timing of these seasons or events may change slightly each year — sometimes they come earlier, sometimes later. This makes it hard to capture seasonality using fixed months or weeks.

The system should be smart enough to learn these shifting seasonal patterns from past data, understand when they usually happen (even if the timing shifts), and apply that learning to forecast future demand more accurately. This ensures that even when seasons or events move, the system still knows what kind of demand change to expect and when to apply it.

Perfect — so the seasonality component in your system will allow the user to specify which time buckets (monthly, weekly, or annual) they want to use for capturing seasonal demand patterns.

Here's a complete and polished User Story for the Seasonality Component, following your documentation format:

📄 User Story: Seasonality Detection Based on User-Defined Time Buckets


---

✅ Overview

The system should allow users to configure seasonality detection by selecting a time bucket — weekly, monthly, or annual. Based on the chosen bucket, the system should identify and learn recurring demand patterns that occur within that time frame, and use them to improve forecasting accuracy. The seasonal patterns should reflect natural business cycles like weekend shopping peaks, monthly bill payments, or annual festive spikes.


---

⚙️ Functional Requirements

The system must provide a configurable parameter for selecting seasonality time bucket.

Accepted values: "weekly", "monthly", "annual".


Based on the selected value:

For weekly, the system should capture day-of-week effects (e.g., higher demand on weekends).

For monthly, the system should capture demand shifts that happen in specific weeks of a month (e.g., month-end sales).

For annual, the system should capture long-term yearly cycles (e.g., Diwali, summer sales).


The seasonality model should learn from historical demand data and apply this learning to improve future demand predictions.

The system should allow switching between buckets without requiring code changes, via configuration.

If no bucket is selected, the system will default to "monthly".

🎯 Acceptance Criteria

✅ User can select one of the supported time buckets (weekly, monthly, or annual) via system configuration.

✅ The system detects and applies seasonality based on the selected bucket.

✅ Weekly bucket captures 7-day cycles and day-specific effects.

✅ Monthly bucket captures demand fluctuations tied to specific weeks/days of a month.

✅ Annual bucket identifies recurring yearly events or long-term seasonal changes.

✅ Switching between buckets reflects correctly in the forecast output.

✅ If no value is selected, the system defaults to monthly seasonality.

✅ The forecast output visibly incorporates seasonal adjustments based on selected time bucket.

💬 Description (In Simple Words)

Different businesses have different seasonal patterns — some see demand go up on weekends, some during the end of the month, and others during specific months of the year.

This seasonality feature lets users choose what kind of pattern is most important to their business — weekly, monthly, or yearly — so the system can adjust forecasts accordingly. That way, the model understands and predicts recurring ups and downs better, making planning more accurate.

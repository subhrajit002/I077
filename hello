I have implemented a drag-and-drop functionality that allows me to move one folder inside another, or place one folder above or below another. However, there is an issue:

If a folder is at the very top of the list, I cannot drag another folder above it.

Similarly, if a folder is at the very bottom, I cannot drop another folder below it.


I want to be able to drag and drop folders anywhere — above, below, or inside any folder — without these restrictions.

Please help me fix this.
